# Repository automation

Common CI and image mechanics are maintained in [abhi1693/actions](https://github.com/abhi1693/actions).
Workflows use the released `@v1` reference for centrally maintained compatible updates.
See the [shared release history](https://github.com/abhi1693/actions/releases) for changes.
Repository-owned scripts, triggers, scanner exceptions and application smoke checks
remain alongside the application. Image manifests declare components rather than
copying workflow steps.
